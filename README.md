# BCFF_Kiosks
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W kiosks to play custom content.

Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W's are loaded with RPI Lite 32-bit, and worked with remotely. All /boot .txt files are loaded by default.
Currently trying to get them to default to one network, and change to another if it becomes active.

Loaded onto 10 cards for 10 units
-2 designated to play custom youtube private stream
-8 for electronic bulletins, controllable by me via wordpress extention "Enable Media Replace" to change infographics at a static URL
